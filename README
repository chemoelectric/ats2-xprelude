Extensions to, and bugfixes for, the ATS2 prelude.
--------------------------------------------------

THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

* Expanded support for integer types, and workarounds for bugs.

* Expanded support for floating point, and workarounds for bugs.

* 32+32-bit fixed point, treated as if it were floating point.

* Optionally: exact rationals (via the GNU Multiple Precision
  Arithmetic Library)--garbage-collected, and treated as if they were
  floating point.

* Planned but not yet added: sorting by default algorithms that you do
  not have to think about. (For array sorting, the preferred
  implementation will be ats2-timsort. I suppose ats2-quicksorts may
  also be made available as choices. And the preludeâ€™s own sort
  implementations.)
